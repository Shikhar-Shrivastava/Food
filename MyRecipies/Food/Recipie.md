1. Grease the base of the tin and sprinkle some flour or granulated sugar over it, till well coated.
2. In a mixing bowl break the eggs one at a time.
3. Add the sugar, vanilla, salt and baking powder and beat well till it becomes light and foamy.
4. You will know that it is beaten enough when the mixture leaves a trail when the beater is lifted and moved above the batter. This trail soon blends back into the batter.
5. With a rubber spatula, fold in 1 tbsp of the flour with light cutting, downward, upward and outward strokes. Add the rest of the flour in the same way.
6. Bake in a pre-heated oven for about 15 minutes. Put in a sharp knife, and if it comes out clean, the cake is done.
7. When cool, sprinkle half the pineapple syrup on one, layer with whipped cream and the chopped pineapple. Cover with the other cake layer, sprinkle syrup and cover with cream all over.
8. Decorate with the pineapple slices and chill.
